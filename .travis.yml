#Below skips the installation step completely (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Skipping-the-Installation-Step)
#We need it because otherwise Travis CI injects an awkward './gradlew assemble' step into the CI workflow
#We want to control and decide what Gradle tasks are executed
install:
 - true

script:
  # We are using && below on purpose
  # ciPerformRelease must run only when the entire build has completed
  # This guarantees that no release steps are executed when the build or tests fail
  - ./gradlew assemble -s -PcheckJava6Compatibility && ./gradlew check && ./gradlew -i ciPerformRelease
